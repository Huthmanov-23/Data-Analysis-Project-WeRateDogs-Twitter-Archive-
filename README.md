# Data-Analysis-Project-WeRateDogs-Twitter-Archives
The aim of this report is to gather data from a variety of sources and in a
variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it using python
and its libraries. The dataset I am attempting to wrangle is the twitter data
archive of the user @dog_rates also as WeRateDogs which was provided as
one of the projects of the Udacity Nanodegree Program. WeRateDogs is a
Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the
dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators,
though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why?
Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers
and has received international media coverage.
